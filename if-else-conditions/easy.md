## Thermometer
Create a program that acts as a thermometer. Ask the user for his body temperature and determine if the user has a fever, high fever, mild fever or healthy. Body temperature higher than 39 is an indication of high fever. Temperature between 39-38 indicates a fever and 37 is a sign of a mild fever. Other temperature that is lower than 37 indicates that the user is healthy.

#### Example
```
Enter body temperature: 36
You are healthy
```


## Sashimi Vendor
Create a program for a small sashimi business. The business sells 2 kinds of sashimi, tuna and salmon. Price varies depending on the kind of sashimi. Tuna sashimi prices 200 pesos and Salmon sashimi prices 300 pesos. Ask the user what kind of sashimi he wants to buy then ask for a payment. Determine if there's any change then display if there's any. Display "thank you for your payment" if the user pays the exact price.

#### Example
```
What kind of sashimi are you buying? 1-Tuna 2-Salmon 1
Enter payment: 300
Your change is 100 pesos.
```
