## Area of Rectangle
Create a program that calculates the area of a rectangle. The formula for getting the area of a rectangle is a = l x w (length multiplied to width). Ask the user for length and width then calculate and display the area.

Enter Width: 5
Enter Height: 6
Rectangle area is 30

Create a program that determines if a number is odd or even number. Ask the user for a number input then display if the given number is odd or event.

#### Example:
```
Enter number: 8
The number is even
```


## Multiples of 10
Create a program that determines a number is multiple of 10 (10, 20, 30, 40 and so on). It can be said that the number is multiple of 10 when you divide it by 10 and there's no remainder.

#### Example
```
Enter number: 8
The number is not multiple of 10

Enter number: 300
The number is multiple of 10
